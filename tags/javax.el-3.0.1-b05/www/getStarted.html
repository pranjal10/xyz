Expression Language, referred to as EL,
 was first introduced in JSTL 1.0, and later included in JSP 2.0.
A variant of the EL was used in JSF 1.0.  In
JSP 2.1, JSF 1.2 and JSTL 1.2, a unified EL was defined.
<br/><br/>
The JSP, JSTL, and Faces expert group felt that EL is useful beyond
their specifications.  JSP 2.1 MR includes features that enable current
EL to be a pluggable module.
<br/><br/>
One place to learn about EL is to start with <a

Tutorial</a>.&nbsp; <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/tutorial/doc/gjddd.html">Chapter
6</a> provides an excellent introduction to EL.<br>
<br/>

The official specification and javadocs can be downloaded from <a

JSR 245 site</a>.&nbsp;
Javadocs for the EL API (javax.el package) can also be found from
