The first to do is to get on the <a
 href="https://uel.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">project
mailing
list</a>.&nbsp;
<br><br>

<a href="https://uel.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue tracker</a>
can be used to report bugs and submit patches.<br>
<br>
Request to join this project can be made <a
 href="https://uel.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMemberList">here</a>.
Glassfish developers will be accepted with much
fuss.&nbsp; Newcomers will need to partake in discussions and submit
patches, before he/she can be nominated to be a developer,
as is the usual practice in an open source project.&nbsp; It would be a
good idea to <a href="mailto:users@uel.dev.java.net">send an email</a>
to
introduce yourself when requesting to join the project.<br>
